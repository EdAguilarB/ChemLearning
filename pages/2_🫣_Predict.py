## üìä Predict Molecular Properties with Your Trained GNN Model

Welcome to the **prediction** section! Here, you can upload a CSV file containing molecules for which you'd like to **predict properties** using the model you‚Äôve already trained.

### üß† **Important: You Must Train a Model First!**

Before you use this feature, make sure you‚Äôve already trained a GNN model. If you haven‚Äôt, please visit the **'Train GNN'** page to upload your dataset and train your model.

### üìù **Prepare Your CSV for Prediction**

To make accurate predictions, your **CSV file** (in-silico library) must follow the same structure as the dataset you used for training. Please ensure the following:

- The **column names** in your new CSV **must match exactly** with the names from the training dataset, including the SMILES columns and any additional properties you may have included (e.g., molecular features or encoded values).
- Your CSV should contain the same number of **molecule columns** as in the original training dataset.
- If you included additional molecular features (e.g., stereochemistry, molecular descriptors) in the training file, those should also be included in your new CSV file and have the same column names.

#### Example Structure:
| SMILES_1         | SMILES_2        | ...             |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| CCO              | CCC             | ...             |
| CCN              | C1=CC=CC=C1     | ...             |

This ensures that the model can properly interpret the new dataset in the same way it did during training. Any discrepancies in column names or structure could lead to errors or inaccurate predictions.

Once your CSV is ready, simply upload it here, and the app will predict the properties of your molecules based on the trained model! üöÄ
            
To start, upload your **experiment zip file** generated from your training experiments, and then upload your **in-silico library** for prediction.
